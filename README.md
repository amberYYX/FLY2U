# FLY2U -- A platform for individual delivery services
Introduction site: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amberYYX/FLY2U/blob/master/index.html

FLY2U project is for developing a platform for fast and cheap cross-regional transportation using available space of passengers’ luggage in the Digital Nomad era. There are always some messages asking to get small things from other countries in different chatting groups. Why are traditional courier companies not their first choice? Our question starts from this problem recognition. That is why we bring this innovative application on the market in this time!

Making use of travelers’ available luggage space! That is our core idea. FLY2U is premium low-cost transportation service using reliable airline. People who want to share their empty baggage space, or who want to transit/receive what they want from/to abroad can use this platform! We found our value in terms of 'The best value, safe and available'.
